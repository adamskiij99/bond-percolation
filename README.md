# Bond Percolation
Stylised and interactive bond percolation. Moving the mouse left or right will vary percolation parameter, and a new instance is generated on mouse press. The percolation parameter has a nice continuity property: each edge is given some uniformly random number between 0 and 1, which if under the threshold determined by mouse position, will display.

Example at 10% threshold:

Example at 50% threshold:

Example at 90% threshold:
